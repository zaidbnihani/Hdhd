# External inventory: how third-party YouTube clients get playable streams (2026-09-28)

Scope: what yt-dlp, NewPipe(Extractor), LibreTube, Piped, PipePipe, YouTube.js/googlevideo, FreeTube,
Grayjay, Invidious(-companion), ReVanced/Morphe/anddea/rvx, the YouTube-Music Kotlin apps and SmartTube
upstream (yuliskov/MediaServiceCore) do **today** to get media, compared with NewTube's
`MediaServiceCore/.../common/helpers/AppClient.kt` (fork HEAD `795091f7` + uncommitted working tree of
2026-09-28). Every claim carries a source; **[code]** = read in source at the given SHA, **[issue]/[PR]** =
stated by a maintainer/contributor, **[measured]** = NewTube's own measurement (HANDOFF / this week's
Pixel runs). Nothing here was benchmarked by this survey; section (b) is the list of things to benchmark.

SHAs used: yt-dlp `c7fb478` (2026-09-16; master `51bab8a` 2026-09-27 has no later YouTube commit),
Morphe `fccde737f` (2026-09-28), ReVanced GitLab dev `bac650ff8` (2026-08-29), anddea `b5a75d761`,
NewPipeExtractor dev `eb53b79` (2026-09-27) / release v0.26.5, LibreTube `abd9073` (2026-09-28),
PipePipeExtractor `c68e10e` (v5.4.0), innertubex `195bac9` (v0.7.2, 2026-09-28), MSC upstream
`476357b4` (2026-09-27). Clones: `…/scratchpad/{yt-dlp-master,repos/*,rv/*}`.

## 0. The ten things that matter

1. **The ecosystem converged on two anonymous no-PO-token paths: VISIONOS (no JS, no POT, no kids) and a
   JS-player web/TV client for everything VISIONOS refuses.** yt-dlp: `visionos` → kids fallback
   appends `web_embedded` and `tv_downgraded` (requested tv_downgraded first — the queue pops from the end —
   and formats from both are merged). Morphe/anddea: VISIONOS → TV_SIMPLY(+POT) → ANDROID_CREATOR.
   NewPipe dev: VISIONOS only (kids = 360p or nothing). NewTube already has VISIONOS first.
2. **Your WEB_EMBEDDED recipe is exactly yt-dlp's `web_embedded` (since 2026-03-10, PR #16177) and
   MetrolistGroup/innertubex's embed path**, with three differences: yt-dlp/innertubex **never send
   `devicePlaybackCapabilities`** at all; yt-dlp replays the **embed page's whole `INNERTUBE_CONTEXT`**
   (visitor, clientVersion, …) and shares one cookie jar across watch page, embed page and /player;
   innertubex uses a Firefox UA and also sends top-level `thirdParty.embedUrl=https://www.youtube.com/embed/<id>`.
   innertubex's benchmark notes: "Normal and made-for-kids playback passed sustained playback and both
   seek directions after fetching per-video encryptedHostFlags; age-restricted media was rejected."
3. **web_embedded is itself entering a SABR-only experiment** (yt-dlp #17666, 2026-09-10: "Both `mweb`
   and `web_embedded` have become SABR-only in some sessions (except for format 18)"). The Safari UA
   commit c7fb478 exists precisely so that such sessions still get **HLS itags 91–96 (≤1080p, muxed)** —
   which is what NewTube saw for KUcmvVHh_RA on LTE. HLS-for-VOD is a real, maintainer-endorsed fallback.
4. **The 403-then-OK-after-48–68 s is most likely YouTube's forced preroll wait ("fake buffering") —
   a hypothesis until the WEB_EMBED response's ad renderers are checked (candidate 2a).** yt-dlp models
   it (`available_at = now + Σ full preroll ad durations`, or the skip offset when skippable) and sleeps;
   FreeTube does the same from `adSlots` (with a "Remaining preroll-ad time" toast); SABR clients see it
   as `backoff_time_ms`;
   iter.ca (2025-06-20) measured the backoff at **80 % of the ad duration** on the first `/videoplayback`.
   Known avoidances: `contentPlaybackContext.isInlinePlaybackNoAd: true` **plus `inline=1` on the /player
   query** (rvx "Bypass fake buffering"); `adPlaybackContext.pyv=true` (yt-dlp: works for mweb/web_music,
   **did not work for web_embedded** in 2025-12 testing). NewTube sends isInlinePlaybackNoAd but not
   `inline=1`, and does not parse adPlacements/adSlots.
5. **TVHTML5 5.x ("downgraded") is the other kids path and the only no-PO-token one that also plays
   non-embeddable kids videos** (bashonly, 2026-07-20; with a POT, MWEB/WEB SABR/TV Simply also do). It is broken for sessions in the `tcl` player-JS experiment
   ("The page needs to be reloaded", yt-dlp #17389, open, high priority). Working bypasses in the wild:
   Samsung/Tizen 2.4.0 device context (yt-dlp PR #17723, "high priority, will probably be merged very
   soon" — = NewTube TV_TIZEN), an ancient Cobalt UA (SmartTube upstream 2026-09-08:
   `Cobalt/4.13031-qa … Starboard/1`), TVHTML5 **5.20150304** + Tizen (Morphe TV_DASH). NewTube uses
   TV_TIZEN only signed-in under a bot wall — never anonymously for kids.
6. **TVHTML5_SIMPLY + a TV-challenge PO token is Morphe's "plays everything incl. kids" signed-out path**
   (PR #2533, 2026-08-22): challenge from `/tv_config?action_get_config=true`, BotGuard in a WebView,
   `GenerateIT`, a video-bound token in `serviceIntegrityDimensions.poToken` + a visitor-bound `&pot=` on
   every format URL. BgUtils #44 confirms the TV challenge "doesn't require EVENT_ID (yet?)".
7. **WebPO minting changed in late July 2026**: the BotGuard challenge is bound to the page session
   (`yt.config_.EVENT_ID`); tokens minted from `/att/get` challenges are rejected with GVS 403 **~30 s
   into playback** for sessions in the experiment (inference: NewPipe-style `jnn/v1/Create` challenges
   are equally unbound to the page's EVENT_ID) (BgUtils v4.0.3 2026-08-04,
   bgutil 1.3.2 2026-08-21: 58 % → 92 % success). SmartTube upstream ported this (`PoTokenWebView4`,
   2026-08-08/12). **NewTube's fork still selects the old `PoTokenWebView` (`jnn/v1/Create`).** Also: GVS
   tokens are now bound to the **video id** when `html5_generate_content_po_token=true` is in the ytcfg.
8. **android_vr is dead as a default everywhere** (yt-dlp: all formats 403 with 1.65.10 since
   2026-08-17; Morphe: VR needs OAuth sign-in since 08-19 and moved to Pico/XR identities because Quest
   "is being used by too many alternative clients such as yt-dlp, SmartTube, and NewPipe"). IOS has no
   usable VOD without an attested POT (no VOD m3u8 since ~2026-05-18). ANDROID reel needs a POT since
   2026-07-25 (Morphe), except the itag-18 360p muxed floor.
9. **Java/Kotlin SABR now exists and ships**: LibreTube v32 (media3, ~2.3k lines, VISIONOS-sourced),
   Grayjay (native media3 UMP, default since 08-22, WEB/MWEB + WebView POT), PipePipe (ExoPlayer2, MWEB +
   WebView POT), Flow, innertubex (audio only), SmartTube upstream ("very poor … live completely
   unplayable", yuliskov 2026-09-09). yt-dlp's SABR PR #13515 is still unmerged. The "~60 s wall" is the
   `sps` stream-protection status (2 = attestation pending after ~1–2 MB, 3 = required); the fix is a
   **content-bound (video-id) token as raw bytes in `streamer_context.po_token`**. For kids that means
   WEB/MWEB + a good token (VISIONOS SABR never serves kids). Estimate on top of NewTube's `sabr-media3`:
   ~1.5–2.5 focused weeks (§3.6).
10. **Small NewTube hygiene gaps vs the ecosystem**: WEB_CREATOR `1.20241203.01.00` and WEB_REMIX
    `1.20250219.01.00` are ~1–2 years stale (yt-dlp/upstream: `1.20260708.06.00` / `1.20260707.12.00`);
    `TVHTML5_SIMPLY` is sent as client-name id **74** (yt-dlp and Morphe use **75**; YouTube.js has 74);
    IOS goes out as `clientName "iOS"`, osName "iOS" (yt-dlp: `IOS` / `iPhone`; upstream MSC moved to
    osName `iPhone`); no per-client visitor ids (Morphe #2309 made them per client to lower bot score).

## (b) Ranked candidates to benchmark

Ranked by (chance it plays what NewTube can't today) × (cheapness), after an adversarial astra review
(see "Review" at the end). Each is a concrete request variant; "arms" = what to compare. Test set: kids
_WB5hh7WOb4, KUcmvVHh_RA and one **non-embeddable** kids video, an age-gated embeddable and an age-gated
non-embeddable video, one normal control; LTE and Wi-Fi; play past 120 s.

0. **Baseline control first: the complete yt-dlp-shaped WEB_EMBED request** (cheap, diagnostic). Embed
   page fetched **per video** (`/embed/<id>?html5=1`, Safari UA, `Referer: https://www.reddit.com/`);
   /player body = that page's own `INNERTUBE_CONTEXT` (its visitorData and clientVersion) with
   `thirdParty.embedUrl=https://www.reddit.com/`, `contentPlaybackContext{html5Preference,
   signatureTimestamp, encryptedHostFlags}`, `racyCheckOk`, `contentCheckOk` — and **no
   `devicePlaybackCapabilities`, no `isInlinePlaybackNoAd`, no `lactMilliseconds`**; X-Goog-Visitor-Id =
   the same visitor. Compare with NewTube's current body (6 h cached identity, `supportXhr=false`,
   isInlinePlaybackNoAd). Variants from innertubex: Firefox-140 UA, top-level
   `thirdParty.embedUrl=https://www.youtube.com/embed/<id>`, `videoCheckOk`; bashonly's reserve flags
   source `INNERTUBE_CONTEXT.thirdParty.embeddedPlayerContext.embeddedPlayerEncryptedContext`. Every arm
   below should be run against this baseline so differences are attributable.
1. **(joint first) HLS-for-VOD fallback when WEB_EMBED answers SABR-only but carries `hlsManifestUrl`**
   (finding 2 — the phone already receives the manifest, so this is the most concrete lead). Solve the
   `/n/<challenge>` segment in the manifest **path** (yt-dlp substitutes it before fetching and drops the
   manifest if n is unsolved); expect itags 91–96 (144p–1080p muxed H.264/AAC, "worse codecs"); no GVS
   POT is required by yt-dlp's policy (web_embedded has none; web-family HLS is "recommended" only).
   Measure the stages separately — master playlist, media playlist, **first segment** — because "manifest
   present" is not "playable", and yt-dlp only applies `available_at` at download time, i.e. the forced
   wait may also hit the first segment. Arms: with/without `/pot/<web-pot>` appended to the manifest path.
2. **(joint first) Measure, then honour, the preroll wait on WEB_EMBED** (finding 1: 403 at 0.3 s, OK at
   48–68 s). Hypothesis, not yet established: YouTube's forced preroll wait.
   - 2a, measure (cheap, decisive): does the WEB_EMBED response carry `adPlacements[]` with
     `adPlacementRenderer.config.adPlacementConfig.kind == AD_PLACEMENT_KIND_START`, or `adSlots[]` with
     `adSlotMetadata.triggerEvent == SLOT_TRIGGER_EVENT_BEFORE_CONTENT`? Compute yt-dlp's number (Σ full
     `instreamVideoAdRenderer.playerVars.length_seconds`, or `skipOffsetMilliseconds` per ad when
     present — yt-dlp uses full durations, iter.ca measured ~80 %) and compare with the observed window
     per video. If there are no ad renderers, the 403 is something else.
   - 2b, honour: delay the first media request to `available_at` (measure TTFF); overlap the wait
     (prefetch /player for the next queue item; start on another client and switch) or show a countdown.
   - 2c, avoidance arms (speculative): `inline=1` on the /player query + `isInlinePlaybackNoAd:true` (rvx
     "Bypass fake buffering", 2025-09-16); `adPlaybackContext:{pyv:true}` (yt-dlp reports 403s with it on
     web_embedded in 2025-12 — retest); body without `isInlinePlaybackNoAd`/`lactMilliseconds`.
3. **TVHTML5 5.x for kids, anonymous** — yt-dlp's other kids fallback (it actually requests
   `tv_downgraded` **before** `web_embedded`: both are appended and the queue is popped from the end).
   Note the reference checkout uses the plain `Cobalt/Version` UA; Tizen is only in open PR #17723. Arms:
   TV_TIZEN anonymous (today NewTube uses it only signed-in under a bot wall); TV_DOWNGRADED with
   upstream's ancient Cobalt UA `Mozilla/5.0 (DirectFB; Linux x86_64) Cobalt/4.13031-qa (unlike Gecko)
   Starboard/1` **and the real 5-digit sts** — NewTube's `usesTvSignatureTimestamp` still suffixes
   TV_DOWNGRADED with `001` (`AppClient.kt`), so a UA change alone does not reproduce upstream's 09-08
   recipe; TVHTML5 **5.20150304** + Tizen (Morphe TV_DASH). Measure status, formats with URL, 206 at byte 0
   and deep, playback past 60 s. The non-embeddable kids video is the one WEB_EMBED cannot do.
4. **TVHTML5_SIMPLY with a TV-challenge PO token (Morphe PR #2533)**: `GET
   https://www.youtube.com/tv_config?action_get_config=true` (TV UA) → `challengeParams.R` (bgChallenge) +
   `challengeRequestKey` → BotGuard snapshot in the existing WebView → `POST /api/jnn/v1/GenerateIT` →
   (a) video-id-bound token → `serviceIntegrityDimensions.poToken`, (b) visitor-bound token → `&pot=` on
   each format URL. Client-name id **75**, clientVersion 1.1, PS4 device fields. Morphe claims kids
   work; BgUtils #44 says the TV challenge needs no EVENT_ID. Also try that token on TV_TIZEN.
5. **Fix PO-token minting, then re-run the web-POT arms.** Two separate changes: (i) **minting** — port
   upstream's `PoTokenWebView4` (homepage `ytAtN` challenge + ytcfg/EVENT_ID) and log which path actually
   minted (it keeps an `/att/get` fallback, so selecting the class proves nothing); (ii) **binding** —
   NewTube's streaming token is minted against the web visitorData (`PoTokenProviderImpl`), while
   sessions with `html5_generate_content_po_token=true` want it bound to the **video id**. Then: MWEB +
   GVS POT (yt-dlp wiki's general recommendation; bashonly for non-embeddable/age), with
   `adPlaybackContext.pyv` (removes the wait on mweb per yt-dlp); WEB_REMIX `1.20260707.12.00` + GVS POT
   (innertubex's primary; bump the stale version first).
6. **`supportXhr=false` (or no `devicePlaybackCapabilities`) on MWEB, WEB_SAFARI and TV 7.x** for kids
   videos answered SABR-only. yt-dlp never sends the block; rvx's JS clients sent `supportXhr:false`;
   Morphe switched false→true on 2026-02-18 because it wanted SABR. Lower value for IOS and ANDROID_REEL:
   their media also need an attested (DroidGuard/iOS) token, so URLs alone would still hit the ~60 s wall.
7. **WEB_KIDS 2.20260205.00.00 (id 76)** — innertubex keeps it "pending validation"; one probe run is
   cheap (status, URLs vs SABR-only).
8. **itag-18 floor**: when all else fails on kids, `streamingData.formats` itag 18 from WEB_EMBED / MWEB /
   ANDROID reel (NPE, PipePipe). 360p; check it isn't also behind the wait.
9. **Per-client visitor ids** (Morphe #2309: one visitor shared across clients raises the bot score;
   `/visitor_id` per client, refreshed from each response) — for the bot-wall work.
10. **SABR with a proper POT** (the structural fix; §3), after 5: content-bound token as raw bytes in
    `streamer_context.po_token` (and in /player for WEB/MWEB), `sps` 2/3 → re-mint,
    `backoff_time_ms` (= the ad wait), `RELOAD_PLAYER_RESPONSE`, `SABR_REDIRECT`; recheck
    `EnabledTrackTypes` (googlevideo VIDEO_ONLY = 2; STATUS.md assumed none). Arms: **WEB_EMBEDDED SABR**
    (the phone already receives embedded SABR metadata), WEB and MWEB SABR on the kids set. Copy-safe
    references: googlevideo, SmartTube `library/sabr` (MIT); LibreTube/Grayjay for reading only.
11. Low: ANDROID_VR Pico/XR 1.64.34/1.69.27 DASH with an OAuth bearer (Morphe requires sign-in; does it
    accept NewTube's TV device-flow bearer?) — normal videos only, no kids. ANDROID_CREATOR needs an
    Android account token, almost certainly not the TV bearer.

### 1.1 INNERTUBE_CLIENTS — every entry [code]

Common to all: `hl=en`; host `www.youtube.com` unless noted; /player body = page-or-static
`INNERTUBE_CONTEXT` + `playbackContext.contentPlaybackContext{html5Preference: HTML5_PREF_WANTS,
signatureTimestamp?, encryptedHostFlags?}` (+ `adPlaybackContext{pyv:true}` only with
`use_ad_playback_context=true` on mweb/web_music) + `racyCheckOk:true, contentCheckOk:true`;
a player POT goes in `serviceIntegrityDimensions.poToken`. **yt-dlp never sends
`devicePlaybackCapabilities`, `isInlinePlaybackNoAd` or `lactMilliseconds`.** Headers: X-YouTube-Client-Name
(the numeric id below), X-YouTube-Client-Version, Origin, X-Goog-Visitor-Id, User-Agent, cookie auth.

PO-token columns: GVS policy per protocol https / dash / hls. `req` = required, `rec` = recommended,
`!prem` = not_required_for_premium, `!w/pl` = not_required_with_player_token. Blank = nothing required.

### 1.2 Default selection

| situation | clients, in order | since |
|---|---|---|
| signed out + JS runtime | `visionos, web` | 2026-08-18 (dae52d8 / #17461) |
| signed out, no JS runtime | `visionos` (+ "extraction without a JS runtime has been deprecated") | 2026-08-18 |
| signed in (cookies), free | `web_embedded, tv_downgraded, web` | 2026-08-18 (5d5b634 / #17462) |
| signed in, Premium | `web_creator, tv_downgraded, web` | 2026-08-18 |
| signed in + music URL | + `web_music` | – |
| signed in | every client without SUPPORTS_COOKIES is dropped | – |

Before: 2026-07-20 (#17261) `visionos, android_vr, web` / authed `tv_downgraded, web`; before that
`android_vr, web_safari` / authed `tv_downgraded, web_safari`. In the signed-out default `web` mostly
supplies the watch page (`ytInitialPlayerResponse`, microformat — and the literal string `made for kids`
the kids fallback greps for), subtitles and live; its https formats are SABR-only.

### 1.3 Fallbacks and special cases [code, `_extract_player_responses`]

- **Made-for-kids** ([L3146](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/c7fb478/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube/_video.py#L3146)):
  client ∈ {android_vr, visionos} AND status `UNPLAYABLE` or (since 07-20) `ERROR` AND the watch webpage
  contains `made for kids` AND a JS runtime exists → append `web_embedded`, then `tv_downgraded`
  (append order; the client queue is popped from the end, so **tv_downgraded is requested first**;
  formats from both are merged).
  History: 2026-01-31 web_embedded (#15785); 2026-07-20 tv_downgraded, which "makes non-embeddable
  'made for kids' streams now downloadable" (bashonly, #17261); 2026-08-18 both (web_embedded appended first).
  Non-embeddable kids fail on web_embedded with "Playback on other websites has been disabled" (#17252).
- **Age-gate** ([L3156](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/c7fb478/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube/_video.py#L3156)):
  `desktopLegacyAgeGateReason`, or reason contains "confirm your age"/"age-restricted"/"inappropriate",
  or status AGE_CHECK_REQUIRED/AGE_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED → append `web_embedded.<base>` (embeddable
  only). Signed in and still age-gated, or web_embedded UNPLAYABLE (embedding disabled) → append
  `web_creator` (POT; bypasses EU age verification). No tv_embedded-style bypass remains. Maintainer
  advice for non-embeddable age-gated without cookies: "use a PO token provider and the `mweb` client"
  (bashonly, #17497, 2026-08-20). Open: #17542 (age-restricted → itag 18 only, "side effect of #17389").
- **"This video is not available"**: no generic handling; it is how visionos/android_vr answer kids
  (#16693, UNPLAYABLE; ERROR since July, #17252).
- **SABR-only**: a format with neither `url` nor a usable `signatureCipher` is dropped: "Some {client}
  client https formats have been skipped as they are missing a URL … YouTube is forcing SABR streaming
  for this client" (web/web_safari, debug) or "YouTube may have enabled the SABR-only streaming experiment
  for the current session" (others, warning). Tracking #12482 (locked).
- **missing_pot**: formats whose policy says GVS POT required, without one, are skipped
  (`formats=missing_pot` keeps them; HLS gets "MISSING POT" and source_preference −20).
- **encryptedHostFlags**: only for the `embedded` variant, from
  `WEB_PLAYER_CONTEXT_CONFIGS.WEB_PLAYER_CONTEXT_CONFIG_ID_EMBEDDED_PLAYER.encryptedHostFlags` of
  `https://www.youtube.com/embed/{id}?html5=1`, fetched **per video** with the client UA and
  `Referer: https://www.reddit.com/` ([`_download_ytcfg` L993](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/c7fb478/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube/_base.py#L993)).
  The /player context is **that page's own `INNERTUBE_CONTEXT`** (`_extract_context(player_ytcfg)`: its
  visitorData, clientVersion, etc.) with `thirdParty.embedUrl` forced to reddit; the X-Goog-Visitor-Id
  header is the first visitor seen (watch page), and one cookie jar (VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE, YSC) spans the
  watch page, embed page and /player — so it is one visitor end to end. Origin: PR #16177 (2026-03-10)
  fixed #16077 "Error code: 152 - 18"; without a referrer YouTube answers `Error 153 /
  PLAYABILITY_ERROR_CODE_EMBEDDER_IDENTITY_MISSING_REFERRER`, with a youtube.com referrer `152 - 4 /
  EMBEDDER_IDENTITY_DENIED`. bashonly kept an alternative flags source in reserve:
  `INNERTUBE_CONTEXT.thirdParty.embeddedPlayerContext.embeddedPlayerEncryptedContext`. Code comment:
  detectable via experiment `embeds_enable_encrypted_host_flags_enforcement`, "no harm in including
  encryptedHostFlags with all web_embedded player requests". bashonly (#16077): "The web_embedded client
  is routinely broken (and unbroken) by YT. This is why it's only used as a fallback".
- **Forced preroll wait** — see §7.
- **n / sig**: all JS solving via EJS — `yt-dlp-ejs` 0.8.0 (`yt.solver.core.js`, meriyah + astring; no
  release in the window) in deno (default, ≥2.3), node (≥22), bun (1.2.11–1.3.14) or quickjs, plus
  external JSC plugins. By default yt-dlp uses the `main` player variant (`player_ias.vflset/en_US/base.js`)
  instead of what the page prescribes (`player_js_variant=actual` keeps the page's); there is no `tcl` entry — gamer191 (2026-08-08): TVHTML5 now
  uses `tv-player-ias-tcl.js`, which "uses a different signatureTimestamp… yt-dlp-ejs can't yet solve its
  JS challenges"; bashonly: the real fix "demands some major changes to the Youtube extractor and EJS".
- **HLS vs DASH**: HLS manifest path has an `/n/<challenge>` segment that is solved and substituted
  (the manifest is dropped if unsolved) and gets `/pot/<token>` appended when a token exists
  ([L3685](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/c7fb478/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube/_video.py#L3685)).
  web_safari/web_embedded pre-merged HLS is deprioritised −1 for VOD ("may have lower quality audio").
  Live/post-live use "adaptive" https fragments since #16771 (07-04) instead of the DASH manifest.
- **PO-token plumbing**: provider plugins (`pot/`, e.g. bgutil). Content binding ([`pot/utils.py`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/c7fb478/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube/pot/utils.py)):
  GVS → visitor_data (signed out) / data_sync_id (signed in), **or video_id when ytcfg's
  `serializedExperimentFlags` has `html5_generate_content_po_token=true`**; PLAYER and SUBS → video_id.
  WebPO clients: WEB, MWEB, TVHTML5, WEB_EMBEDDED_PLAYER, WEB_CREATOR, WEB_REMIX, TVHTML5_SIMPLY,
  TVHTML5_SIMPLY_EMBEDDED_PLAYER.

### 1.4 Wiki PO-token table (live, last content update 2026-03 by coletdjnz, wiki#71) — stale vs code

| client | POT required for | notes |
|---|---|---|
| web | Subs, GVS | only SABR formats |
| web_safari | GVS* | HLS doesn't need GVS POT "at this time" |
| mweb | GVS | |
| tv | not required | all DRM without cookies; SABR-only in some cases |
| tv_simply | GVS | no account cookies |
| web_embedded | not required | only embeddable videos |
| web_music | GVS | |
| web_creator | GVS | account cookies |
| android / ios | GVS or Player | no cookies |
| android_vr | not required (stale: code says required since 07-20, dead since 08-17) | kids not available |

No `visionos` / `tv_downgraded` rows yet. TL;DR on the page: "Use a PO Token Provider plugin to provide
the `mweb` client with a PO Token for GVS requests"; manual token extraction discouraged because tokens
are now "bound to the video ID". Community client table wiki#81 (unmerged) lists web_embedded as JS
required, no POT, HLS/https/SABR, embeddable only.

### 1.5 SABR in yt-dlp

PR [#13515](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/13515) "[fd/sabr] Add YouTube SABR protocol downloader"
(coletdjnz, opened 2025-06-21) is **open, unmerged, conflicting**; 227 commits, last real work
2026-07-06…08-08 (visionos support, resume, `formats=sabr_live`). bashonly 2026-08-21: "a massive PR and I
need to carve out some serious time". Test build: `yt-dlp --update-to bashonly/yt-dlp@sabr`. Notes in
the PR: `web` SABR still needs a GVS POT; server-side ad wait applies; cold-start POT "out of scope".

### 1.6 Other yt-dlp issues worth knowing (maintainer statements)

- #17226 (07-15): coletdjnz "android_vr is rolling out a pot-like requirement, visionos does not have
  this"; gamer191: visionos has itag 616 (= Premium 1080p enhanced bitrate); only visionos has itag 602.
- #17143 (closed 07-20): bashonly "non-live m3u8 formats are just being gated behind login now …
  android_vr and mweb still see m3u8 formats for livestreams when logged-out"; 07-21 YouTube is
  "phasing out or locking down these m3u8 formats". Contributor: visionos "gives m3u8 without cookies or
  pot or js" (separate video/audio tracks, not muxed).
- #17509 (08-21) bashonly: android_vr "was the client that provided combined video+audio m3u8 formats

## 2. NewPipeExtractor family (NewPipe, LibreTube, Piped, PipePipe, Tubular)

### 2.1 NewPipeExtractor (TeamNewPipe) [code]

- PO token: `setPoTokenProvider()` is a no-op on dev "until SABR support is added"; NewPipe's WebView
  provider returns null for ANDROID/IOS/embed. `&cpn=` (and `&pot=` if present) on stream URLs.
- JS: regex-extracted sig/n run in **Rhino 1.8.1**. Open PR #1545 (09-08) ports yt-dlp EJS n-sig parsing
  and makes the JS runtime pluggable (WebView).
- Kids: PR #1508 (06-09): VISIONOS added; "Videos made for kids cannot be watched with the VISIONOS
  client, so only the 360p muxed stream … can be got." PR #1529 (merged 08-20, `9ed62db`): removes
  ANDROID, IOS and WEB_EMBEDDED_PLAYER ("nobody is able to generate poTokens for first two";
  WEB_EMBEDDED "requires some parameters the extractor doesn't currently support") → "DASH manifests …
  and videos made for kids cannot be played until we can support SABR". The removed embed code had
  `thirdParty.embedUrl=watch URL` + `contentPlaybackContext{signatureTimestamp, referer}` and **no
  encryptedHostFlags**.
- Age-restricted: `AgeRestrictedContentException`, no bypass. "a bot" → SignInConfirmNotBot.
- HLS: `getHlsUrl()` reads VISIONOS (dev) / VISIONOS→IOS→ANDROID (v0.26.5); token as `?pot=` query.
- Timing: no ad parsing, no delay.
- [issue] NewPipe #13824/#13841/#13855 (Sept): 403 at ~59 s on 0.29.1; #13769: kids 360p until SABR;
  #12248 SABR coordination (no code).

### 2.2 LibreTube [code]

- Release v32.0/32.1 (2026-08-20) "implemented SABR"; master `abd9073` (09-28) **removes Piped support**
  ([e7812c7](https://github.com/libre-tube/LibreTube/commit/e7812c76bb8068ae0805253835b4d535f14235db)).
- Extractor: fork `libre-tube/NewPipeExtractor@3e863d7` (08-23, before #1529). VISIONOS first
  ([37c0cc7](https://github.com/libre-tube/NewPipeExtractor/commit/37c0cc7abde265abd9ce4581be0fda9d09353138):
  "Android … recently started to require poTokens"), IOS optional, WEB metadata; exposes
  `serverAbrStreamingUrl`(+cpn) and `videoPlaybackUstreamerConfig`.
- Playback order (`OnlinePlayerService`): **SABR** (non-live) → locally built DASH from non-SABR formats
  → HLS (VISIONOS hlsManifestUrl) only if nothing else.
- SABR stack: Kotlin on **media3**, ~2.3k lines — `SabrClient`, `UmpParser`, `SabrMediaSource/Period`,
  `SabrChunkSource`, protos under `app/src/main/proto/video_streaming`, SABR downloads;
  `streamerContext.clientInfo` hard-coded to VISIONOS 1.02; PO token = cached WEB token from its WebView
  BotGuard (often empty); sends MediaCapabilities (09-07), buffered ranges, playback cookie; honours
  backoff ([SabrClient.kt L359](https://github.com/libre-tube/LibreTube/blob/abd907390b016504e6954e5546aa370a8f50526c/app/src/main/java/com/github/libretube/player/parser/SabrClient.kt#L359)).
- Kids: no workaround (VISIONOS). Open: #8630 "fall back to DASH/HLS if SABR fails", #8760 buffering.

### 2.3 Piped (TeamPiped/Piped-Backend) — stalled

Last commit 2026-05-30; pinned `FireMasterK/NewPipeExtractor@c83884e` (pre-VISIONOS: ANDROID reel,
optional IOS, WEB metadata); `BgPoTokenProvider` = external bgutil server, WEB tokens only; no SABR.
Piped #4257 (08-03): maintainer has a private SABR solution, looking at `TeamPiped/rustypipe` (Rust).
Open PR #895 (09-27) bumps NPE.

### 2.4 PipePipe (InfinityLoop1308) — the most actively fighting [code]

Extractor `c68e10e` (v5.4.0, 2026-09-24), client `c2a166f`.

- PO token: `LocalDomPoTokenProvider` + `assets/sabr_po_token.js` (WebView BotGuard, content- or
  session-bound, 07-19 `9d962af`); rejected attestation identities rotated (08-02).
- JS: yt-dlp **EJS** solver in an Android WebView (`WebViewJavaScriptDecoder`), fallback remote
  `api.pipepipe.dev/decoder/decode`.
- SABR: Java, `services/youtube/sabr/**` (~4–5.8k lines incl. client), rewritten 08-11 (media3 dropped
  → ExoPlayer2); v5.2.5 (08-07) disabled SABR, v5.3.0 (08-24) restored it.
- Timing: the only NewPipe-family project that parses ads (yt-dlp and FreeTube do too) — `updateAvailableAt()` sums `length_seconds`
  (`skipOffsetMilliseconds` overrides) over START adPlacements + BEFORE_CONTENT adSlots
  ([L2037](https://github.com/InfinityLoop1308/PipePipeExtractor/blob/c68e10e2e97495877832d8df6cbac55478083019/extractor/src/main/java/org/schabi/newpipe/extractor/services/youtube/extractors/YoutubeStreamExtractor.java#L2037)),
  but only attaches it to SABR streams and the client never reads it. What it does enforce is the SABR
  server backoff (`NextRequestPolicy.backoffTimeMs`, capped at 30 s, with a "YouTube forces us to wait N
  seconds" notification — [SabrBackoffCoordinator](https://github.com/InfinityLoop1308/PipePipeClient/blob/c2a166f7df05e5ace4c80fb3e3fd27702cfc3e56/app/src/main/java/org/schabi/newpipe/player/SabrBackoffCoordinator.java)).
- HLS VOD: only post-live (n solved in the `/n/` path), no pot.

Tubular: discontinued (README 2026-07-07); `feuerswut/Tubular-Revived` follows NewPipe 0.29.1.


## 3. YouTube.js, googlevideo (SABR), FreeTube, Grayjay, Invidious — and SABR on media3

### 3.1 LuanRT/YouTube.js (youtubei.js) — v18.1.0 (2026-09-22), HEAD `bad89d2` [code]

Clients (`src/utils/Constants.ts`): IOS `20.11.6` (iPhone10,4, iOS 16.7.7.20H330), WEB `2.20260623.01.00`,
MWEB `2.20260205.04.01`, WEB_KIDS `2.20260205.00.00`, WEB_REMIX `1.20250219.01.00`, ANDROID `21.03.36`
(SDK 36), ANDROID_VR `1.65.10` (Quest 3, SDK 32), VISIONOS `1.02` (RealityDevice17,1, 26.5.23O471, Safari 26
UA; added 08-12 `e518645`), TVHTML5 `7.20260311.12.00`, TVHTML5_SIMPLY `1.0` (**id 74** in
`CLIENT_NAME_IDS`), TVHTML5_SIMPLY_EMBEDDED_PLAYER `2.0` (EMBED, embedUrl youtube.com),
WEB_EMBEDDED_PLAYER `1.20260206.01.00` (EMBED, embedUrl google.com — stale `1.x` prefix), WEB_CREATOR
`1.20241203.01.00`, ANDROID_CREATOR `22.43.101`, ANDROID_MUSIC `5.34.51`. (NewTube's `innertube/utils/
Constants.kt` is derived from this file — hence NewTube's id 74 and stale WEB_CREATOR/WEB_REMIX.)
`getInfo`/`getBasicInfo` default to WEB (`Session.ts:384`). PO tokens are caller-supplied →
`serviceIntegrityDimensions.poToken`; no minting, **no encryptedHostFlags**. Deciphering: downloads
`player_es6.vflset/en_US/base.js`, extracts n/sig with a meriyah AST, evaluates via a caller-provided
`Platform.shim.eval`. SABR: only exposes `server_abr_streaming_url` and `sabr://` DASH output for
googlevideo. Open PR #1248: `BotGuardManager` (page + API challenges, ytcfg EVENT_ID).

### 3.2 LuanRT/googlevideo — the reference SABR client [code]

Release v4.1.1 (2026-07-13); HEAD `44e360a` has an unreleased rewrite (#54, 09-23: livestreams, memory
leaks, corrected proto names; #56 09-24 "ignore unused streams").
- **UMP framing** (`UmpReader.ts`): varint whose length comes from the first byte (<0x80→1, <0xC0→2,
  <0xE0→3, <0xF0→4, else 5 bytes), then part type, size, payload; MEDIA/MEDIA_END start with a 1-byte
  header_id.
- **Request**: POST to the n-deciphered `serverAbrStreamingUrl` + `&rn=N`, `content-type:
  application/x-protobuf`, `accept: application/vnd.yt-ump`, `accept-encoding: identity`.
- **VideoPlaybackAbrRequest**: `client_abr_state` (1), `initialization_format_ids` (2),
  `buffered_ranges` (3), `video_playback_ustreamer_config` (5, from
  `playerConfig.mediaCommonConfig.mediaUstreamerRequestConfig`), selected audio/video format ids (16/17),
  captions (18), `streamer_context` (19: `client_info{client_name id, client_version, os…}`, `po_token`=2,
  `playback_cookie`=3, `sabr_contexts`=5, `unsent_sabr_contexts`=6), `ssap_playback_infos` (24).
  `EnabledTrackTypes {VIDEO_AND_AUDIO=0, AUDIO_ONLY=1, VIDEO_ONLY=2}` (`formatUtils.ts`) — NewTube's
  STATUS.md says "there is no video-only value": recheck.
- **Server messages**: wait `NextRequestPolicy.backoff_time_ms` and echo its playback cookie;
  `SABR_REDIRECT` swaps the URL; `RELOAD_PLAYER_RESPONSE` → re-call /player with
  `playbackContext.reloadPlaybackContext`; `SABR_CONTEXT_UPDATE` + sending policy; `SABR_ERROR` throws;
  `CUEPOINT_LIST` ads echoed with AdState RATECONTROL_CLIENT (11).
- **PO token in SABR**: the **content-bound (video-id) token, base64url-decoded to raw bytes**, in
  `StreamerContext.po_token`; never a `pot` query param (googlevideo `SabrStream.buildRequestBody`,
  Grayjay `SabrSession.resolvePoToken`, SmartTube `SabrProcessor.createStreamerContext`; YouTube.js
  `Player.ts:204` skips `pot` when `sabr=1`). For WEB/MWEB the same token also goes into /player
  `serviceIntegrityDimensions.poToken`.
- **The ~60 s wall = stream protection status (`sps`)**: 1 = OK; 2 = attestation pending (a cold-start
  or missing token still gets ~1–2 MB, then the client must re-mint); 3 = attestation required (nothing
  more). googlevideo re-mints via `onMintPoToken` up to 5 times. Matches NewTube's positional 56–60 s wall
  (HANDOFF §28). LuanRT (googlevideo #38, 2025-10-07): web now needs content-bound tokens; the TV client
  "doesn't use PO tokens yet". Cold-start token: BgUtils `WebPoMinter.createColdStartToken` (MSC has
  `PoTokenGate.getColdStartPoToken`). ~60 s cutoff reports #38/#45/#52/#53; #53 fixed (2026-08-22) by
  page-challenge minting.
- **Onesie**: only an example (`examples/onesie-request`, TV `onesieHotConfig` key); nobody uses it in
  production.
- Users: FreeTube (protos + UmpReader with its own Shaka plugin), invidious-companion (URL helpers).

### 3.3 FreeTube — HEAD `9a1dd60`, v0.25.3-beta (2026-08-28) [code]

`youtubei.js ^18`, `googlevideo ^4.1.1`, `bgutils-js ^4.0.3`, Shaka 5.1. Client **WEB**, from the watch
page's ytcfg INNERTUBE_CONTEXT + `ytInitialPlayerResponse` (`src/renderer/helpers/api/local.js:441-500`);
WEB_EMBEDDED only as the age-gate fallback. Content-bound PO token minted in Electron (hidden
`WebContentsView`) from the page's `ytAtN` + `window.yt={config_}`, `/att/get`+`eacrToken` fallback
(`src/main/poTokenGenerator.js`). SABR via its own Shaka scheme plugin (segment index from sidx/Cues;
marks the other track fully buffered so each response carries one segment; `sps`=3 invalidates the
token). SABR for VOD since #8047 (2025-09-19), always on since #8542 (2026-01-18); #9689 redirect fix
(08-25), #9753 robustness (09-10). **Preroll wait**: reads `adSlots` BEFORE_CONTENT (skip offset else
length_seconds) into `adEndTimeUnixMs` (`local.js:778`) and delays loading with a "Remaining preroll-ad
time" toast — legacy/DASH only; for SABR it honours `backoffTimeMs`. Live: DASH/HLS manifests with
`/pot/` in the path; #9545: YouTube sometimes forces SABR for live (no manifest).

### 3.4 Grayjay — plugin `847a46f` (v364), app futo-org/grayjay-android `d033244` [code]

Primary /player: WEB ytcfg from youtube.com (MWEB + iPad UA when logged in). Also VISIONOS `1.04` (UA
`com.google.visionos.youtube/1.04 (RealityDevice17,1; U; CPU visionOS 26_6_0 like Mac OS X; US) gzip`, on
since 08-24), ANDROID_VR `1.65.10` (off since 08-22), ANDROID `21.03.36`. **Native UMP/SABR in Kotlin on
media3 1.9.0** since 2026-07-14, on by default since 08-22; streamer context WEB `2.20250923.08.00`, osName
Windows. Token session-bound (visitorData) or video-bound per player config, BotGuard in a WebView with a
V8+JSDOM fallback, plus a cold-start token; `sps`=3 → `SabrBlockedException` and a reload
(`SabrSession.kt:1002`). HLS only for live (`?pot=`). License "Source First 1.1" (non-commercial) —
read, don't copy.

### 3.5 invidious-companion / Invidious [code]

Companion `bb3b37f`: /player WEB + content-bound token, falling back to **TV_SIMPLY → ANDROID_VR → MWEB**
when `adaptiveFormats[0].url` is missing; TV when OAuth is on (`src/lib/helpers/youtubePlayerReq.ts`).
Token from a jsdom worker (bgutils 3.2.0) using the **old `/att/get` challenge**. YouTube.js 18.0.0
(09-05). No SABR (proxies `/videoplayback`; UMP proxy issue #10 open since 2024). Invidious: SABR issue
#5263 open.

### 3.6 SABR on Android/media3 — what exists and what it would take

| project | language / player | license | size | state |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| yuliskov/SmartTube `exoplayer-amzn-2.10.6/library/sabr` | Java, ExoPlayer 2.10.6, port of yt-dlp's SABR processor | MIT | ~8.6k LOC | active (f406bc7 09-17); yuliskov 09-09: "very poor … live or past live videos are completely unplayable" |
| NewTube `sabr-media3` | media3 1.10.1 | MIT | — | opt-in, off in release (dies ~60 s without POT except VISIONOS) |
| LibreTube `player/` | Kotlin, media3 | GPL-3.0 | ~2.3k LOC | shipped v32 (08-20), VOD only, VISIONOS context |
| grayjay-android `sabr` | Kotlin, media3 1.9.0 | Source-First 1.1 | ~5k LOC | default on since 08-22 |
| A-EDev/Flow `player/sabr` | Kotlin, media3 1.11.0 | GPL-3.0 | ~3.6k LOC | active 09-28; SABR only as an upgrade when direct streams top out <720p |
| PipePipeExtractor `sabr` + client | Java, ExoPlayer2 | GPL-3.0 | ~5k LOC | MWEB + WebView POT; rewritten 08-11 |
| innertubex `sabr` | Kotlin MP, audio only | GPL-3.0 | ~2.5k LOC | experimental; Metrolist ships `allowSabr=false` |
| chadacious/sabr-exoplayer | Kotlin, media3 1.4.1, DASH + `sabr://` DataSource | MIT | ~3.4k LOC | dormant since 2025-11 |
| felipeucelli/JavaTube | Java downloader | MIT | — | default VISION_OS since 09-06 |

Copy-safe for MIT NewTube: SmartTube, googlevideo, sabr-exoplayer, JavaTube, yt-dlp (Unlicense). GPL and
Grayjay: reference only.

Architectures: (a) custom MediaSource/MediaPeriod + ChunkSampleStream fed by a session pump (Grayjay,
LibreTube, SmartTube, NewTube `sabr-media3`); (b) DASH manifest with `sabr://` URIs + DataSource
(sabr-exoplayer; Shaka analogue in FreeTube); (c) one progressive source per track + merge (Flow;
simplest, no ABR).

Checklist beyond what NewTube's `sabr-media3` already does (UMP, request builder, VISIONOS end-to-end):
(1) a /player client that serves the wanted video by SABR — for kids that means WEB/MWEB (+ content POT)
or WEB_EMBEDDED; (2) `client_info` in `streamer_context` identical to the /player client (Flow: extra OS
fields on web trigger reloads); (3) POT bytes (content-bound, decoded) + cookie echo + SABR contexts;
(4) `sps` 2/3 → re-mint; (5) RELOAD_PLAYER_RESPONSE handshake keeping buffers and CPN; (6) SABR_REDIRECT,
URL expiry, fallback hosts; (7) backoff (= the ad wait, see §7); (8) a minter that uses the homepage
`ytAtN` challenge + EVENT_ID with the same UA/visitor as /player. **Estimate: ~1.5–2.5 focused weeks** on
top of NewTube's existing module (mostly the POT pipeline, `sps`, reload, expiry and a kids test sweep);
4–8 weeks from scratch.


## 4. ReVanced / Morphe / anddea / rvx ("spoof video streams")

Where the code lives: **ReVanced** GitHub repo (and 702 forks) DMCA-blocked since 2026-03-24 (notice filed
by a Morphe team member); development on gitlab.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches, dev `bac650ff8`
(2026-08-29), latest release v6.2.1 (2026-06-02). **Morphe**: github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches, dev
`fccde737f` (2026-09-28), v1.44.0 (2026-09-21); inotia00 wrote nearly all spoof commits. **inotia00/rvx**:
end-of-life 2026-03-10. **anddea**: active, v4.3.0 (2026-09-28), playback code = Morphe's, a few days
behind.

**How they differ from NewTube structurally**: they hook the official app's own /player, fire the spoofed
request alongside it and swap in only `streamingData` (+ Morphe `playerConfig`). Ads come from the
stock response, so the stock app runs its own preroll timing — they never need a wait of their own.
Field masks: Morphe `player?fields=responseContext.visitorData,playabilityStatus,streamingData,playerConfig&alt=proto`;
ReVanced `fields=streamingData&alt=proto` or reel `fields=playerResponse.playabilityStatus,playerResponse.streamingData`.
None sends `adPlaybackContext`. No spoof client uses `hlsManifestUrl` for VOD ("HLS … can theoretically be
played with ExoPlayer, but the related code has not yet been implemented"), none puts a POT on HLS.

start playback"). No playbackContext, no POT, no JS. Since 06-02 (`6a7ba9fce`) X-YouTube-Client-Name
carries the name string, not the id (possibly a bug). All of Reel/VR/visionOS carry "Video may stop at
1:00, or may not be available in some regions". Open MR !6979: YT Music 9.32.51 SABR "wants a
Proof-of-Origin token. microG's attestation token is rejected"; "ANDROID_REEL_NO_AUTH returns 403".

Notes:
- Upstream already sends `encryptedHostFlags` for embedded clients (`YtCfgService.getCachedEncryptedHostFlags`,
  since ~2026-05-03 `4175ffaf`) but **not paired with the embed page's visitor** and with
  **`supportXhr = !isTVClient`** (i.e. `true` for WEB_EMBED) — the two things NewTube found necessary.
  Its ring comment still says WEB_EMBED "not working".
- Upstream body for every client: `contentPlaybackContext{html5Preference, lactMilliseconds:60000,
  isInlinePlaybackNoAd:true, signatureTimestamp, encryptedHostFlags?}` +
  `devicePlaybackCapabilities{supportsVp9Encoding:true, supportXhr: !isTV}`. No ad parsing / wait.
- iOS HLS for "extended/high-bitrate formats" on VOD is an opt-in format setting
  (`MediaServiceData.FORMATS_EXTENDED_HLS`, `hasExtendedHlsFormats`).
- SABR lives in the SmartTube app repo, `exoplayer-amzn-2.10.6/library/sabr` (Java, ~8.6k LOC, port of
  yt-dlp's SABR processor; see §3.6). Community: Jupiops' SABR test build `32.11-sabr.1` (2026-08-09,
  SmartTube #6030). yuliskov 2026-09-09 (#6030): "the 99 percent of issues are related to resent
  switching to sabr. The current state of sabr implementation in our app is very poor. E.g. live or
  past live videos are completely unplayable"; 09-12: "YouTube made an account lock for smart TV's"
  (support thread 466491931). Latest WIP builds 32.57/32.59 (09-25/27).


## 6. YouTube Music Kotlin apps and other libraries

records per-client benchmark evidence (Android benchmark 2026-08-13, SABR benchmark 08-20). Metrolist
(app `28fa8f0`) pins v0.7.0 and calls `extract(allowHls=false, allowSabr=false)` — direct URLs only.

GET `/embed/<id>?html5=1` (Firefox UA, `Referer: https://www.reddit.com/`, no cookies); regex
`encryptedHostFlags`, `visitorData`, sts, `INNERTUBE_CLIENT_VERSION` (abort if flags or sts missing);
/player with `context.thirdParty.embedUrl=https://www.reddit.com/`, **top-level

Referer reddit, `X-Goog-Visitor-Id`, Origin youtube.com; media with Referer/Origin youtube.com and 1 MiB
ranges. Its harness asserts **206 on the first ranged GET, no wait, no 403 retry** (`Playback.kt L395`) —
so on 2026-08-13 its (unpublished) samples had no preroll wait. Catalog note: fresh tokenized MWEB URLs
"can return several transient HTTP 403 responses before becoming usable". Fallback chain: VISIONOS fast
path → watch-page config candidates by priority (WEB_KIDS first for known kids) → embed config → WEB_KIDS
guess. JS: yt-dlp EJS on QuickJS (`quickjs-kt` 1.0.14). Metrolist app on media 403/410: invalidate URL,
mark client failed, refresh cipher, re-extract after `RETRY_DELAY_MS` (excludes the client rather than
waiting).

### 6.2 Others

- **SimpMusic** (`maxrave-dev/core@0b9ce7b`, 09-26): WEB_REMIX /player (1.20260304.03.00, sts = days since
  epoch) for metadata; streams from a PipePipeExtractor fork (VISIONOS + reel fallback) with a local QuickJS
  decoder → remote api.pipepipe.dev decoder → BravePipeExtractor; HEAD check of URLs.
- **ArchiveTune** (rukamori/core): preferred client → VISIONOS **0.1** (now 400 per innertubex) →
  ANDROID_VR 1.65.10 → WEB_REMIX → WEB → MWEB → WEB_CREATOR; `youtube_clients.json` has WEB_EMBEDDED
  2.20260708.00.00 flagged `isEmbedded`.
- **OuterTune**: no longer developed (points to Metrolist/ArchiveTune).
- **lavalink-devs/youtube-source** (Java, Discord bots): `NonMusicClient.fetchEncryptedHostFlags` scrapes
  `/embed/<id>` for the flags.
- **A-EDev/Flow** (Kotlin, media3 1.11): direct streams first, SABR only as a quality upgrade (<720p),
  3 s budget.
- **JavaTube** (Java downloader): default client VISION_OS since 09-06.


## 7. Timing and delivery types

Two Pixel-9 findings of 2026-09-28 frame this section: (1) WEB_EMBED (embed identity) answers OK for
made-for-kids _WB5hh7WOb4 with 26 URL formats, the first media request ~0.3 s later is **HTTP 403 (12/12,
LTE and Wi-Fi)**, the same URLs work **48–68 s later**; (2) for kids KUcmvVHh_RA on LTE, WEB_EMBED answers
OK with adaptive formats **SABR-only but with an `hlsManifestUrl`**.

### 7.1 The forced preroll wait ("fake buffering")

**What YouTube does.** iter.ca, "YouTube's fake buffering" (2025-06-20): InnerTube tells GVS to back off
on the **first** `/videoplayback` of the content — "InnerTube is providing GVS streams that will give a
backoff of 80% of the ad duration for ads for the first `/videoplayback` request" (15 s ad → 12 s; 6 s +
15 s unskippable → 16.8 s); applied to everyone in the A/B test, invisible to normal users because
the ad plays meanwhile. On SABR it arrives as `NextRequestPolicy.backoff_time_ms`; on URL formats it
shows up as 403s until the time passes (bashonly, 2026-08-18: not waiting "likely gives a 403"). rvx's
settings text: "When a video ad is blocked, GVS generate fake buffering proportional to the ad duration
(A/B testing)". NewTube's 48–68 s window is consistent with 80 % of ~60–85 s of prerolls (or the
full ad time) — to be checked against the response's ad renderers.

**yt-dlp's `playback_wait` history** [code/PR]:
| date | change | behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| 2025-08-20 | a97f4cb, PR [#14081](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/pull/14081) "Handle required preroll waiting period" (fixing #13930 "The following content is not available on this app" / 403) | extractor arg `preroll_sleep`, default 6 s, applied to all non-live formats |

**Current algorithm** ([`_get_available_at_timestamp` L3823](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/c7fb478/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube/_video.py#L3823)),
per client response, all clients:
- renderers = `adPlacements[*]` where `adPlacementRenderer.config.adPlacementConfig.kind ==
  AD_PLACEMENT_KIND_START` → `adPlacementRenderer.renderer`, plus `adSlots[*]` where
  `adSlotRenderer.adSlotMetadata.triggerEvent == SLOT_TRIGGER_EVENT_BEFORE_CONTENT` →
  `fulfillmentContent.fulfilledLayout.playerBytesAdLayoutRenderer.renderingContent` (and each
  `playerBytesSequentialLayoutRenderer.sequentialLayouts[*]…renderingContent`) → `instreamVideoAdRenderer`;
- per ad: `skipOffsetMilliseconds/1000` if present ("YT allows skipping this ad; use the wait-until-skip
  time"), else `playerVars` → `length_seconds`;
- `available_at = ceil(now) + Σ`; applied to every non-live format **including HLS/DASH manifest
  formats**; the downloader sleeps until `max(available_at)` (`downloader/common.py:465`).

**Avoiding it**:
- `use_ad_playback_context=true` → `playbackContext.adPlaybackContext = {pyv: true}` — yt-dlp allows it
  only on `mweb` and `web_music` (PR #15220, 2025-12-03: "on some videos, using this in combination with
  some clients results in 403-s"; tester: web_embedded "did not work" on qoeLkZ_CExg); "Do NOT use this
  when passing premium account cookies" (loses premium formats).
- rvx "Bypass fake buffering" (3941a5d9, 2025-09-16): **`inline=1` query param on /player** +
  `contentPlaybackContext.isInlinePlaybackNoAd: true` (iter.ca: with it "InnerTube won't serve you any
  ads"). NewTube (and SmartTube upstream) already send `isInlinePlaybackNoAd:true` in every body but
  **no `inline=1`** (`VideoInfoApi.java`: bare `/youtubei/v1/player`).

**Who waits before the first media request** (all [code]):
| project | behaviour |
|---|---|
| yt-dlp | computes `available_at` from ads (above), sleeps; SABR PR: `_check_vod_ad_wait` sleeps on backoff |
| FreeTube | `adSlots` BEFORE_CONTENT → `adEndTimeUnixMs`, delays player load with a "Remaining preroll-ad time" toast (legacy/DASH); SABR: honours `backoffTimeMs` |
| PipePipe | computes `availableAt` like yt-dlp but never uses it; enforces SABR backoff (cap 30 s) with a "YouTube forces us to wait N seconds" notification |
| LibreTube, innertubex, Grayjay, googlevideo | SABR backoff only; no wait for URL formats |
| NewPipeExtractor, YouTube.js, invidious-companion | nothing |

### 7.2 HLS for VOD

| client | VOD HLS today | GVS POT on HLS | source |
|---|---|---|---|
| web_embedded + Safari UA | **itags 91–96 (144p–1080p, muxed H.264/AAC, "worse codecs")**, also when adaptive is SABR-only | none required (no policy) | gamer191 #17666 (09-16), c7fb478 |
| web_safari | 91–96, but "since 2026.07 only returned with some logged-in or 'trusted' sessions" | not required ("at this time"), recommended | `_base.py`, wiki, #17143 |
| visionos | m3u8 with **separate** video/audio tracks (incl. itag 602), no cookies/POT/JS | none | #17143, #17226 (contributors) |
| ios | none for VOD since ~2026-05-18; live only | **required** ("HLS Livestreams require POT 30 seconds in") | #16764, `_base.py` |
| mweb / android_vr / android | live only (android_vr dead since 08-17; `android` = live m3u8 workaround) | mweb: recommended | #17143, #17509 |
| TVHTML5_SIMPLY | innertubex "two-token HLS" passes kids | `?pot=` + cpn | innertubex catalog |

Mechanics (yt-dlp [L3685](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/c7fb478/yt_dlp/extractor/youtube/_video.py#L3685)):
the manifest URL path contains `/n/<challenge>`; solve it with the player JS and substitute it (yt-dlp
drops the manifest if unsolved); append `/pot/<token>` to the path when a token exists (FreeTube does the
same for live; NPE and innertubex use a `?pot=` query instead). Pre-merged HLS is ranked below DASH/https
for VOD ("pre-merged m3u8 formats may have lower quality audio") but is a legitimate fallback. Timing
has stages: yt-dlp fetches and parses the master playlist during extraction, but applies `available_at`
only when downloading the chosen format — so for NewTube, master playlist, media playlist and the first
segment can each fail independently; "a manifest was returned" does not yet mean "HLS plays".

Who uses HLS for VOD as a fallback: **yt-dlp** (web_safari/web_embedded, deprioritised), **LibreTube**
(VISIONOS HLS as third choice after SABR and local DASH), **innertubex** (when no direct formats, and
always for TVHTML5_SIMPLY), **SmartTube upstream** (opt-in iOS "extended HLS" formats), **NPE**
(`getHlsUrl`, VISIONOS). Not: ReVanced/Morphe ("HLS … related code has not yet been implemented"),
PipePipe (post-live only), FreeTube/Grayjay/invidious-companion (live only).


## 8. PO-token minting state (what changed under everybody)

- **Challenge bound to the page session (late July 2026).** LuanRT, BgUtils PR [#44](https://github.com/LuanRT/BgUtils/pull/44)
  (merged 2026-08-04, v4.0.3): "YouTube started binding the initial attestation challenge to the
  `yt.config_` object (specifically `yt.config_.EVENT_ID`). As a result, WebPO tokens generated using
  challenges from `/att/get` are now rejected if your session is part of the experiment and you are using
  the `WEB` or `MWEB` InnerTube clients". Fix: take the initial `window.ytAtN(...)` challenge and the
  `ytcfg` from the **same** youtube.com page and inject `yt.config_` before the BotGuard snapshot.
  EDIT 2 in the PR: "the attestation challenge from the TV client can be used. It doesn't require
  `EVENT_ID` (yet?)" — `GET /tv_config?action_get_config=true&client=lb4&theme=cl` →
  `challengeParams.R.bgChallenge` + `challengeRequestKey` → `GenerateIT`.
- **bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider** issue #242 (07-27→08-21): "YouTube / GVS has occasionally rejected the
  tokens … responding with HTTP 403s after half a minute"; PR #243 (1.3.2, 2026-08-21) ports the homepage
  pair: stock `/att/get` **14/24 (58 %)** vs homepage pair **22/24 (92 %)** success; one extra homepage
  fetch per minter, not per token. 2.0.0 (09-08) security fixes only.
- **SmartTube upstream** ported it as `PoTokenWebView4` (a722df75 08-08, default since 3d9521ff 08-12).
  **NewTube's fork still selects `PoTokenWebView`**, which uses `https://www.youtube.com/api/jnn/v1/Create`
  + `GenerateIT` (`potokennp2/generators/PoTokenWebView.kt:124,168`). Minting and binding are separate
  problems: NewTube's streaming token is minted against the web visitorData
  (`PoTokenProviderImpl.kt` ~L193, `generatePoToken(webPoTokenVisitorData)`), and `PoTokenWebView4` keeps
  an `/att/get` fallback (L138), so selecting it does not prove the homepage path minted — log it.
- **GVS token binding moved to the video id** where the ytcfg experiment
  `html5_generate_content_po_token=true` is set (yt-dlp detects it and binds GVS to video_id; wiki: tokens
  are now "bound to the video ID"; inotia00 #468: only MWEB and WEB_REMIX still take visitor-bound tokens).
  SABR takes the content-bound token as raw bytes in `streamer_context.po_token`.
- **TV Simply cold-start token** (Morphe #2533): `/tv_config` challenge, video-bound PL token + visitor-bound
  GVS token, challenge cached ~6 h.
- **Android attestation** (DroidGuard) remains out of reach for everyone except Morphe's external
  PotHelper (keybox) and anddea's hard-coded provider; microG tokens have been invalid for ~2.5 years
  (Morphe #2618). This is why ANDROID/IOS/ANDROID_VR/ANDROID_REEL are dying for everyone.
- **invidious-companion** still mints from `/att/get` (bgutils 3.2.0) — expect it to hit the same 403s.


## 9. NewTube vs the ecosystem: request-shape diffs worth knowing

| item | NewTube (fork working tree 2026-09-28) | ecosystem | why it may matter |
|---|---|---|---|
| `devicePlaybackCapabilities.supportXhr` | `!isTVClient && !isEmbedded` → **true** for WEB, WEB_SAFARI, MWEB, IOS, VISIONOS, ANDROID* | yt-dlp/innertubex: block never sent; rvx: false; Morphe: true (wants SABR); upstream MSC: `!isTV` | measured: WEB_EMBED true → SABR-only, false → URLs. Unmeasured on the other clients |
| `isInlinePlaybackNoAd` / `lactMilliseconds` | sent to every client with an sts | yt-dlp: never; rvx: isInlinePlaybackNoAd **+ `inline=1` query** | the preroll wait (§7) |
| `/player` query | bare `/youtubei/v1/player` | Morphe/NPE: googleapis host + `fields=`/`alt=proto`, `t=`, `id=`; rvx: `inline=1` | ad data, fingerprint |
| embed identity | flags + visitor cached **6 h**, not per video; static body | yt-dlp/innertubex: embed page **per video**; yt-dlp replays the page's whole `INNERTUBE_CONTEXT`; innertubex uses the page's `INNERTUBE_CLIENT_VERSION`, top-level `thirdParty.embedUrl=/embed/<id>`, `videoCheckOk` | robustness if flags turn out per-video in some sessions |
| PO-token minter | `PoTokenWebView` (`jnn/v1/Create` challenge) | upstream MSC `PoTokenWebView4`, bgutil 1.3.2, BgUtils 4.0.3, FreeTube: homepage `ytAtN` + ytcfg EVENT_ID; Morphe: TV `/tv_config` challenge | GVS 403 ~30 s in for web tokens in the experiment |
| TVHTML5_SIMPLY client-name id | **74** (from YouTube.js) | yt-dlp, Morphe, PipePipe, innertubex: **75** | header/body mismatch is a cheap fingerprint |
| IOS | `clientName "iOS"`, osName `iOS` | yt-dlp `IOS` / osName `iPhone`; upstream MSC osName `iPhone` (07-18) | IOS is non-viable anyway without attestation |
| WEB_CREATOR version | `1.20241203.01.00` | `1.20260708.06.00` | only if ever used (needs cookies) |
| WEB_REMIX version | `1.20250219.01.00` | `1.20260707.12.00` (yt-dlp, upstream, innertubex) | candidate 5 |
| WEB / MWEB / WEB_EMBEDDED versions | 2.20260708.00.00 / 2.20260708.05.00 / 2.20260708.00.00 | upstream MSC 09-13: 2.20260907.06.00 / 2.20260907.05.00 / 2.20260908.01.00; yt-dlp still 20260708 | yt-dlp refreshes clientVersion from page ytcfg anyway |
| TV_DOWNGRADED UA | `Mozilla/5.0 (ChromiumStylePlatform) Cobalt/Version` | upstream: `(DirectFB; Linux x86_64) Cobalt/4.13031-qa … Starboard/1`; PR #17723 Tizen (= TV_TIZEN) | tcl experiment |
| visitor per client | shared web visitor for web family + ANDROID_VR + VISIONOS (`usesWebVisitorData`), embed-page visitor for WEB_EMBED, app visitor for the rest | Morphe: one `/visitor_id` visitor per client, refreshed from each response | bot score |
| ad-wait handling | none | yt-dlp, FreeTube | finding 1 |
| VOD HLS fallback | only iOS "extended HLS" opt-in (inherited) | yt-dlp, LibreTube, innertubex | finding 2 |
| SABR `EnabledTrackTypes` | STATUS.md says "no video-only value" | googlevideo: VIDEO_ONLY = 2 (Grayjay sends 2) | SABR correctness |

## Review (cross-model, 2026-09-28)

An adversarial pass by OpenAI `gpt-6-astra` (codex-agent, read-only, 93k tokens; raw output in
`…/scratchpad/inv/codex-review.md`)
checked the draft against the local sources. Accepted and applied: yt-dlp requests `tv_downgraded`
**before** `web_embedded` for kids (append order vs pop order — verified at `_video.py:3053/3063`); the
reference `tv_downgraded` is plain Cobalt, Tizen is only the open PR; the preroll-wait explanation is a
hypothesis until the ad renderers are checked, and yt-dlp waits full ad durations (the 80 % is iter.ca's
measurement); Morphe's TV_SABR declares no PO token; yt-dlp's `main` player variant is a default, not
forced; FreeTube also parses prerolls; HLS failure stages; NewTube's TV_DOWNGRADED still gets the `001`
sts suffix (`usesTvSignatureTimestamp`), so a UA swap alone is not upstream's recipe; PO-token minting
vs binding. Ranking changes: a single yt-dlp-shaped WEB_EMBED baseline added as #0, HLS-VOD promoted to
joint first, preroll split into measure / honour / avoid, the supportXhr sweep demoted for IOS/ANDROID
(they need attestation anyway), WEB_EMBEDDED SABR added to the SABR arms. Not changed: the claim that
the 48–68 s window matches "fake buffering" stays as the leading hypothesis because every independent
source (yt-dlp #14081/#14646, iter.ca, rvx, FreeTube) describes exactly a first-request refusal lasting
about the preroll length.
