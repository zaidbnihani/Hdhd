 * duplicated per activity: LAN multicast/unicast (SSDP/DIAL/mDNS) dies with EPERM without the
 * permission, so ask first, then open the picker - on denial too, because manual "Link with TV
 * code" pairing is a plain internet call and still works.
 *
 * <p>Each host activity routes its {@code onRequestPermissionsResult} through
 * {@link #handlePermissionResult}; presentation stays per-screen via
 * {@link CastPickerSheet.SheetPresenter} (the player passes its immersive-safe
