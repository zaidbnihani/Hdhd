/**
 * NEWTUBE(fullscreen): when the fullscreen button's forced orientation goes back to the sensor,

 * the phone is held; once the phone is physically held that way, the force has done its job and
 * rotation follows the phone again - so turning the phone upright after entering fullscreen with
 * the button exits fullscreen, and a phone laid sideways after leaving it with the button enters
 * it again.
 *
 * <p>Fed with {@link OrientationEventListener} angles (0 = upright, 90/270 = on either side). The
 * phone has to stay in the target orientation for {@link #SETTLE_MS} before the hand-over, so the
 * system's own rotation sensor (which debounces too) already agrees when the request is freed -
 * freeing it earlier could let the display snap to the stale orientation for a frame.</p>
