# Runs a command with the Pixel on LTE: Wi-Fi off (guarded) for the command's duration, back on
# afterwards. Same rules as pixel-lte-run.sh: the Wi-Fi toggle needs guard.sh start (NewTube or
# launcher focused, no shade, awake, no call); the restore falls back to "no call active" after
# 5 min of failed guards; a phone-side timer restores Wi-Fi after 4 h if this PC dies; the command
# is stopped if Wi-Fi comes back on mid-run (its results would no longer be LTE).
#
# Network toggles never use the in-call opt-in: every guard here runs with GUARD_ALLOW_CALL unset
# (the owner's rule, 2026-09-29: dropping Wi-Fi mid-call can cut a Wi-Fi-calling or WhatsApp call).
#
# Usage: NETBENCH_SERIAL=<adb serial> pixel-lte-wrap.sh <log-file> <command...>
# The guard (device/guard.sh) and the wrapped command read the same NETBENCH_SERIAL.
